## Set RTC module with current date and time


After connection, edit the DS1302_settime.ino with the current time and quickly upload it.
Then explore the other sketches to make stuff work with 'current time' as set by previous.


## How to use latest sketch for best updates!


After connections (standalone WIP); download and open then upload the GMClatest.ino.
